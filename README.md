# Tubefy Backend

This is the backend repository for Tubefy, a dynamic music streaming app that leverages the YouTube API for content and provides a rich user experience with real-time features. This backend is designed to handle user authentication, playlist management, and real-time communication.

## Technologies

Tubefy's backend is built with the following technologies and libraries:

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A document-based, distributed database designed for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js, used for making API calls to external services.
- **Bcrypt**: A library to help you hash passwords, ensuring the security of user credentials.
- **Cookie-Parser**: A middleware which parses cookies attached to the client request object.
- **Cors**: A node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
- **Cryptr**: A simple encrypt and decrypt module for node.js, used for securing sensitive information.
- **fs & fs-js**: File system modules to interact with the file system in a secure and reliable way.
